when is 'While' loop statement used? and when is 'For' loop statement used?


While : When you don't know the number of iterations in advance, and the loop depends on a condition
ex) Waiting for user input, running until a countdown reaches zero

For : When you know the exact number of iterations or need to iterate over a range/sequence
ex) Counting from 1 to 10, iterating over an array
